		<h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
		<p>Our goal is to fight hunger and reduce food waste. We created this organization in order to connect businesses with non-profit organizations to support communities in need of food</p>
		<p>The process is super quick and simple. Here's how it works:</p>
		<p>When a provider or nonprofit organization signs up for an account on FoodBox, it joins an online network of other providers and nonprofit organizations in the Bay Area that have already signed up with FoodBox. At the end of a business-day, if a provider has surplus food, it can submit a short post on FoodBox with details about what food items are available for pick-up and at what time. Any nonprofit within a certain radius of the business can then "grab" the post to notify the provider and other nonprofits that they'll be picking up the food. FoodBox also works to create direct partnerships between providers and nonprofits in order to ensure that food assistance is more reliable.</p>
