# Broncohack 2017: FoodBox UI

**Designed with:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

To practice my front-end skills and better familiarize myself with the Bootstrap library, I am redesigning the UI of a web app that was built with a team during a hackathon that I shortly participated in. 

The original web app and design can be viewed here: https://broncohack-2017.herokuapp.com/ .
The new design (currently in progress) can be viewed here: https://tharnlas.github.io/broncohack-2017/ .
